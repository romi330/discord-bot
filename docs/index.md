### **2️⃣ Configure Automod (Optional)**
Paul works out of the box, but you can customize Automoderation settings using a dynamic button system, allowing users to fine-tune their preferences. With this feature, administrators can easily create custom rules for actions like deleting specific words, spam, or even flood based on specific keywords, user behavior, or other triggers. The dynamic button system provides a user-friendly interface, where each button corresponds to a different action or setting that can be enabled or adjusted in real-time. Whether you're dealing with spam, inappropriate language, or disruptive behavior, this customization ensures your moderation system is tailored to your community's unique needs.
